A simple alien-invasion game with Java


This old game was made by me in 2010 when I was still learning how to do graphic stuff with Java. Over the years, I have refused to do some improvement on this work... like multithread the GUI, create better graphic object, upgrade the game logic, etc.

I purposely reserved this graphic program in its original form just to see where I was then, and how far I have come over the years
